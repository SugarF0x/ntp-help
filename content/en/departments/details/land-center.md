NTP Land Center provides comprehensive organizational, legal, land management and technical assistance
to investors in the Moscow region for the creation of commercial real estate.

The center is engaged in the search and selection of plots according to the customer's criteria, regardless
of the availability of relevant offers from the owners or realtors in the public domain.

Based on our practice, there are always plots whose characteristics are better than those offered for sale,
but their actual owners or other legal owners do not have title documents or the fixed category
of land use does not allow the plot to be involved in an effective economic turnover.

In such cases, the work agreed with the owner of the site and the investor is carried out, aimed at eliminating
such shortcomings and stage-by-stage formation of the transaction.

Services also include land surveying, formation of land management documentation,
state registration of rights with the Federal Registration Service.

We also provide a range of services for the transfer of land plots from one category to another,
in compliance with all the legal and organizational procedures established for this.

The center has extensive experience in relocating Moscow industrial enterprises outside the Moscow Ring Road.
