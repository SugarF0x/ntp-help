[the review of the claim](https://rspp.ru/events/news/o-zavershenii-rassmotreniya-obedinennoy-komissiey-po-korporativnoy-etike-pri-rspp-pretenzii-ilinaadaeva-filippa-olegovicha-v-otnoshenii-nikulina-maksima-leonidovicha-66eae21bf1b98/?sphrase_id=4208634)
filed by Philipp Ilin-Adaev, founder of the Banks.ru project and owner of Russia's largest foam glass manufacturer, ICM Glass Kaluga, against the former head of the plant.

The arbitration panel, chaired by the dean of the Faculty of Economics of Moscow State University,
Professor A.A. Auzan, agreed with our arguments and found the actions of the former top manager of the enterprise inconsistent with the Charter of Corporate and Business Ethics.

Currently, there are more than twenty separate legal disputes in progress,
some of them with claims exceeding 900 million rubles.

### 15.11.2016
A land asset with an area of 16 hectares, intended for housing construction and adjacent
directly to the Federal highway in the Moscow region, has found a new owner.

In the resulting legal dispute, we were able to defend a position that did not
previously have a stable judicial practice: at the end of a public auction in a bankruptcy case, 
[the bankruptcy manager can sell the debtor's real estate by collecting requests from a limited number
of interested parties](http://kad.arbitr.ru/Document/Pdf/e7ab2eb4-dfb1-488f-939f-c498ddf82b60/A41-5150-2011_20160823_Opredelenie.pdf?isAddStamp=True).

This "closed bidding" mechanism, which is not directly provided for by the bankruptcy law,
significantly increased the efficiency of the sale and allowed to realize land for 40 million rubles more,
thereby increasing the percentage of satisfaction of creditors' claims.

Partners of NTP Business Consulting [took part in the final session of the Presidium
of the Supreme Arbitration Court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7BJREcr40w&feature=youtu.be&t=2s).

On the last day of the work of the Presidium of the Supreme court of the Russian Federation
as a court of reviewing authority, a case was considered on the status of townhouses as individual
or multi-apartment buildings for the purposes of bankruptcy procedures.

This issue is extremely relevant from the point of applying the features of bankruptcy of developers,
since more than 30% of the construction objects that fell into bankruptcy during 2010 - 2014 on the territory
of the Moscow region alone falls on this format of real estate.

In the case considered, the members of the Presidium agreed with our position: townhouses are not apartment
buildings "by definition" and can be assigned to one or another category depending on the availability
of common property or architectural and design decisions that were taken during construction.

#### Update from 15.01.2017
The review of this case served as a basis for reviewing the regulatory status of townhouses in bankruptcy procedures.

Starting in 2017, blocked residential buildings are included in the list of construction projects
that are subject to special rules on bankruptcy of the developer.

This important innovation of the legislation will allow to protect the interests of shareholders
in case of bankruptcy of developers in low-rise construction to a greater extent.
