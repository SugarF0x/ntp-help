Legislated in 2018, the institution of the Hereditary Fund:
- ensures the exact execution of the will of the testator in relation to his business and other assets;
- allows you to quickly and efficiently set up a mechanism for managing hereditary assets;
- protects the business assets of the Testator from dispersion or loss, which is especially important for the period immediately after the opening of the inheritance;
- protects the interests of heirs who are not active in business, including minors (the beneficiaries of the Fund);
- minimizes, and often completely eliminates the risks of hereditary disputes.

Our services include reviewing the current state of family assets; advice on proven standards and options;
author's developments of the Fund's functioning mechanisms that are not regulated by regulations;
preparation of the Charter and the Fund Management Conditions, support of the notarial procedure
for the creation of the Hereditary Fund.

As a result, the responsible Founder of the Fund receives a kind of "red button" in case of sudden death,
and his heirs - a clear and well-known mechanism for managing the inheritance.
