Summary. In recent years, there has been an increase in allergic reactions to the so-called "latent allergens".
To date, a large number of allergens and substances of various natures are known,
which may be classified as hidden allergens. However, their role and place in the realization
of side reactions, including allergic reactions, have not been sufficiently studied.
This report presents data on medical and legal problems of "hidden allergens" in clinical practice.

Unfortunately, at present, the “art of healing” has been replaced by popular scientific
articles and brochures on medicine, in which the population is “taught” how to treat diseases.
Uncontrolled intake of medications contributes to the formation of LA and allergy to AS.
A certain fly in the ointment is also made by some pharmaceutical companies that advertise their products,
including among the employees of the pharmacy chain, inviting them to recommend their drugs
to patients who visit the pharmacy.

The lack of unified approaches to medical terminology has now generated not only medical problems, but also legal ones.

So, at the beginning of 2011, the Moscow Arbitration Court considered the claims
of BIOCAD CJSC against the authors of articles on hidden allergens and on the problems
of drug allergy to local anesthetics published in the RAJ (2009) due to the fact that
the drug genferon was named as an example , among other multicomponent drugs containing
the so-called latent allergens, and a specific case of the development of AR on genferon,
which contains three different drugs in chemical composition and mechanisms of action
(interferon alfa-2b, benzocaine and taurine). (9.10). As compensation claimed, the Claimant also assessed
its business reputation at an amount comparable to the annual income of the authors of the publication.

As a general rule, when considering such cases in accordance with Art. 152 of
the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the plaintiff must prove the fact of dissemination of information,
their defamatory nature. The defendant is obliged to argue the compliance of the information with reality.

In a particular case, the courts adopted the general idea of the admissibility of a correct scientific discussion,
when “it is not people but ideas that are criticized”, indicating in the relevant
decisions - “the text of the article submitted by the plaintiff does not use the plaintiff’s business
name and does not contain any other information allowing identify him. Under such circumstances,
the argument about the dissemination of information about the plaintiff by the defendants contradicts
the factual circumstances of the case, since the authors do not name the plaintiff and
do not give any assessment of his activities.

Moreover, with reference to the Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation
"On the practice of considering cases on the protection of honor, dignity and business reputation",
the courts agreed with the position of the Defendants that specific publications contain not a statement of facts,
but a professional evaluative opinion, which excludes the possibility prosecution, since the relevant
judgments (especially in medicine, which is not an "exact science") cannot be checked for compliance
with objective reality.

The refusal of claims was also facilitated by the correct methodology for the preparation of relevant
scientific publications with the introduction of new, unsettled terminology.
Using quotation marks when referring to "hidden allergens", the authors gave their own, quite definite
meaning of this term, which excludes any other, including negative interpretation.
In the context of the trial, with reference (literally) to the dictionary of the Russian language,
the participants in the process had to remember that quotation marks are used, except for the well-known
case - quotation, also when using words in their indirect, unusual meaning. This kind of argumentation
is very typical for court cases on the protection of business reputation, since the court should establish
whether certain verbal constructions are negative and defamatory. In this case, the court indicated that
“the Claimant, therefore, asks to refute the information about the presence in Genferon of invisible allergens
that need verification, while the Claimant himself, in the annotation to the preparation, instructions for
its medical use, directly indicates possible allergic reactions, thereby confirming their possibility and likelihood."

(in the latter case, the quotation marks indicate a quote from the Decision of the Moscow Arbitration Court in case
[№А40-112567/2010](http://kad.arbitr.ru/data/pdf/d66fbba9-d0fc-4a41-a2cd-0739bf19de83/A40-112567-2010_20110207_Reshenija+i+postanovlenija.pdf)).

Also, from the point of view of law, it should be noted that publications on clinical cases and medical research with
a negative result, in principle, cannot have an illegal (defamatory) character.

The Russian Federation ratified the "Declaration of Helsinki by the World Medical Association" adopted in 1964
("Ethical Principles of Medical Research with Human Participation as an Object of Research.")

Paragraph 30 of the Declaration (last revised - Seoul, 2008) states: “Authors, editors and publishers
have ethical obligations regarding the publication of research results. Authors are required
to publicize the results of their research on human subjects and are responsible for the completeness
and accuracy of their communications. They must obey accepted guidelines for ethical reporting.
Negative and non-indicative, as well as positive results should be published or made public in another way."    

Clause 4. Article 15 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation establishes that
“The generally recognized principles and norms of international law and international treaties
of the Russian Federation are an integral part of its legal system. If an international treaty
of the Russian Federation establishes rules other than those provided for by law, then the rules
of the international treaty shall apply. " This provision is reproduced in Art. 3. Federal Law
"On the Circulation of Medicines" No. 61-FZ.

Thus, given the priority of international legislation over national legislation, publications about negative results
are legitimate and cannot be assessed as defamatory information.
